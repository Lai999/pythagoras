# Pythagoras

Pythagoras is a collection of geometry classes, the implementations of which
were adapted from the Apache Harmony project. The Pythagoras library aims to
provide performant, portable geometry routines for projects that cannot make
use of `java.awt.geom` (for example for use in GWT projects or Android
projects).
